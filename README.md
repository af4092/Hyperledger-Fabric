1.PROBLEM STATEMENT:
    Major issues of our today’s topic are black money and their negative consequences on the government’s economy and ordinary people   
    lifestyle. Counterfeit money is used illegally and its usage without paying any tax in the domestic market brings inflation
    in the economy. Moreover, little work has been done to the analysis of the impact of the black market exchange rate on the long-run
    demand for money in economies that have black market activities for their currencies, like less economically developed 
    countries: India, Pakistan, Uruguay and others. To be precise, foreign currency exchange rate in black market as double as the price
    in the governmental official bank. 
   
2.SOLUTION:
    Ideal solution for the problem stated above is to come up with an efficient monitoring system which should have no any vulnerabilities
    against tracking counterfeit money and their usage in the domestic market. Monitoring should be done efficiently and without any delay.
    What is important, the solution should ensure that fake money is detected and inform the user as well as authority about its existence 
    in the system. So that preventive action could be taken immediately. Better solution for this case would be the implementation of the
    Hyperledger Fabric technology. By making the ledger of all transactions including money serial numbers, our system automatically
    detects any kind of counterfeit money and prevents their usage in the market. 

3.PROPOSED WORK:
    I have developed the Black money usage tracker web application based on Hyperledger Fabric Network, which monitors all transactions
    efficiently and securely. Our money-app runs on Hyperledger network and interaction can be done with terminal as well as on any web 
    browser which illustrates all transactions on the ledger, and enables to interact with them. As a matter of fact with our proposed
    project any kind of counterfeit money can be traced and prevented from being used in the real world. This is definitely
    production-ready app, however serves as a micro demonstration of how we can trace and prevent of black money from being used in the 
    domestic market. The project is built on Hyperledger Fabric, an open-source blockchain framework run by the Linux Foundation. 
    The application is the adaption of the excellent sample Web API. Blockchain’s distributed ledger approach differs from traditional 
    databases as its records are decentralized. There is no single point of failure for the data storage, and the ledger is synchronized
    across the network, which in this case could comprise transaction details of money used in the economy, banks, people and authorities.
    The process of keeping the ledger up to date with all parties in agreement is through Hyperledger Fabric’s process of consensus. 
    This involves ordering of transactions or transfer of money and participating peers on the network to agree on and commit changes 
    to the ledger.
